üîç Why is None better than 0 in this case?
Using...	          Means...	              Problem
guess = 0	        First guess is 0      	But the user didn‚Äôt guess yet!
guess = None	    Not guessed yet	        Safely avoids confusion

Also:
0 is a valid number in some games (like 0‚Äì100), so it‚Äôs a real guess.
None is not a number ‚Äî so it can‚Äôt accidentally match or interfere with the game.
